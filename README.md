# Golf Odyssey 
A 3D mini-golf game set in dynamic environments. The player must navigate obstacles that move in real-time. 
Unlike traditional golf, where obstacles are static, our game introduces moving obstacles like rotating windmills.  
Players must carefully time their shots and consider environmental interactions to complete each hole with the fewest strokes possible and before time runs out.
The game will utilize realistic physics-based interactions, including ball bounce, making each course a challenge of both skill and strategy.
